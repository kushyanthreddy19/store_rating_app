## API Information
The client interacts with the server using Axios for making HTTP requests. The base URL for the API is set to `http://localhost:5000/api`. The API includes endpoints for user authentication, store ratings, and reviews.

## Project Working

### Overview
The Store Ratings application is designed to allow users to rate and review various stores. It consists of two main components: a client-side application built with React and a server-side application built with Node.js and Express.

### Client-Side Functionality
- The client application provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. Users can log in, view stores, submit ratings, and read reviews.
- The application uses React Router for navigation between different pages, such as the admin dashboard and user dashboard.
- Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the server, allowing the client to fetch and send data.

### Server-Side Functionality
- The server application handles incoming requests from the client, processes them, and sends back appropriate responses.
- It uses Express to define routes for various API endpoints, such as user authentication, store ratings, and reviews.
- The server manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring that user ratings and reviews are stored securely.

### Client-Server Communication
- The client communicates with the server using Axios, sending requests to specific API endpoints defined in the server application.
- The server processes these requests, interacts with the database if necessary, and returns responses to the client, which are then displayed to the user.

### Key Features
- User authentication: Users can register and log in to their accounts.
- Store ratings: Users can rate stores and leave reviews.
- Admin dashboard: Admin users can manage stores and view user ratings and reviews.
